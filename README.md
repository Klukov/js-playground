# JS Playground

A clean, minimalist, and slightly experimental personal space for JavaScript micro-apps, prototypes, and experiments.

## 🚀 Projects

The playground currently features:
- **Kwadraty** – An interactive square-based experiment.
- *More coming soon...*

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS**
- No frameworks or external dependencies
- Dynamic project loading via `data/apps.js`
- Responsive design with a dark, developer-focused aesthetic

## 📂 How to Add New Apps

Adding a new experiment is simple:

1. Create a new folder for your app (e.g., `my-new-app/`).
2. Add your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` inside that folder.
3. Register the app in `data/apps.js`:

The landing page will automatically render a new card for your project.

## 🎨 Design

- **Theme:** Dark by default
- **Typography:** Strong, clean, and modern
- **Visuals:** Subtle CSS-only animations and geometric grid elements
